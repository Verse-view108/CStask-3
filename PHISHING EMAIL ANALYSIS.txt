PHISHING EMAIL ANALYSIS 

DATE: November 14, 2025
PURPOSE: Learn to spot phishing emails safely. Use sample files only and do not open real suspicious emails!

Things to keep in mind:
- Never click links or open attachments in real emails.
- Working in a safe folder as I have stored in E:\Isolated\.
- Delete samples after analysis.

TOOLS YOU NEED (FREE):
- Notepad++ (download: notepad-plus-plus.org) - for viewing .eml files.
- Chrome or Firefox or Edge or any browser - drag .eml file into browser for real time view.
- MX Toolbox Header Analyzer or Google Email Header analyzer: https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx - Paste headers here to check fake or real.

SAMPLE DOWNLOADS:
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/rf-peixoto/phishing_pot - Free real phishing .eml files (for education only).
  - Go to: https://github.com/rf-peixoto/phishing_pot/tree/main/email
  - Click any .eml file → "Download" or "Raw" → Save as "sample.eml".
  - Examples: Bradesco, PayPal fakes. Anonymized - safe.

THE 8 EASY STEPS TO ANALYZE ANY PHISHING EMAIL
-------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: GET A SAMPLE EMAIL
- Download from above links (e.g., phishing_pot/email folder).
- Save as: sample.eml in E:\Isolated\.
- Open in Notepad++ (UTF-8 encoding). If garbled: File > Encoding > UTF-8.
- Test: Scroll top - see "From:" line? Good!

STEP 2: CHECK SENDER (IS IT FAKE?)
- In Notepad++: Find "From:" line (top).
  - Example: From: "Bank" <fake@ gmail.com>
- Ask: Matches real bank? (e.g., Real Bradesco: @bradesco.com.br)
- Red flag: Free email like @gmail.com or weird domain.
- Note: "Sender: fake@gmail.com - SPOOFED!"

STEP 3: CHECK HEADERS (HIDDEN CLUES?)
- In Notepad++: Copy TOP to FIRST BLANK LINE (headers only).
- Paste into: https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx → "Analyze Headers".
- Look for:
  - SPF/DKIM: "Fail" or "None" = BAD.
  - IP: Click IPs - Wrong country? (e.g., USA for Brazilian bank).
  - Hops: Too few (1-2) = Forged.
- Note: "Headers: SPF Fail, IP in USA - FORGED!"

STEP 4: FIND LINKS OR ATTACHMENTS
- Scroll to body (after blank line).
- In browser view (drag .eml to Chrome): Look for blue links/buttons.
- Hover links - copy URL (don't click!).
- Attachments? Note name - scan at virustotal.com (upload safely).
- Red flag: Fake domain (e.g., bank-login-fake.com).
- Note: "Links: fake-site.com - DANGEROUS!"

STEP 5: SPOT URGENT WORDS
- Read body: Words like "URGENT", "EXPIRES TODAY", "ACT NOW"?
- Example: "Points expiring in 24 hours!"
- Red flag: Pushes you to click fast, no proof.
- Note: "Urgency: 'Expiring today' - PANIC TRICK!"

STEP 6: CHECK HIDDEN LINKS
- In browser: Hover over links/buttons.
- Compare: What it says vs. real URL.
  - Example: Button "Login" → real: evil.com
- Paste URL to urlscan.io (safe preview).
- Note: "Mismatch: Looks safe, goes to fake site."

STEP 7: LOOK FOR ERRORS
- Read body: Finding any Typos? Bad grammar? Weird spelling?
  - Example: "Verfy now" or run-on sentences.
- Paste to grammarly.com (free).
- Red flag: Professionals don't mess up.
- Note: "Errors: Typos like 'LIVEL O' - AMATEUR!"

STEP 8: MAKE YOUR REPORT
- Quick table in Notepad:

| Step | What I Found | Why It's Phishing |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2    | Fake sender  | Wrong domain      |
| 3    | SPF Fail     | Forged headers    |
| 4    | Fake link    | Steals info       |
| 5    | Urgent words | Makes you panic   |
| 6    | URL hide     | Tricks eyes       |
| 7    | Typos        | Sloppy scam       |

- Verdict: "High risk - DELETE & REPORT!"
- Report to: abuse@realbank.com or phishing.org.
